# Electric Vehicle Market Size Analysis (Python)

This project analyzes electric vehicle registration data to understand how EV adoption has grown over time and how the market is evolving.

The dataset used is `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`, which contains detailed information about registered electric vehicles including model year, city, county, make, model, electric range, and vehicle type.

## What I Did

- Analyzed EV adoption trends over the years
- Identified top counties and cities with highest EV registrations
- Studied distribution of electric vehicle types
- Found the top 10 most popular EV manufacturers
- Analyzed top models within leading manufacturers
- Examined electric range distribution
- Calculated average electric range by model year
- Forecasted EV registrations up to 2029 based on historical growth

## Key Insights

- EV adoption has increased significantly in recent years
- A small number of counties contribute to a large portion of registrations
- Certain manufacturers dominate the EV market
- Electric range has improved steadily over newer model years
- Growth trend suggests continued market expansion

## Visualizations Included

- EV adoption over time (bar chart)
- EV distribution by vehicle type
- Top 10 EV manufacturers
- Top models within top 3 manufacturers
- Distribution of electric range (histogram)
- Average electric range by model year (line chart)
- Forecasted EV registrations (actual vs estimated)

All plots were generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
